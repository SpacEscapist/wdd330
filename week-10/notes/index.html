                <strong><em>Validating Forms</em></strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                Client-side validation is important to allow the user to fix
                errors right away, however, this should be used in conjunction
                with server-side validation. This is because client-side
                validation is too easy to bypass.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are two different types of client-side validation. They
                are "built-in form validation" and "JavaScript validation".
                <br />
                <strong>Built-in form validation</strong> uses HTML form
                validation features. It provides for better performance since it
                doesn't use much JavaScript, however it is not as customizable.
                <br />
                <strong>JavaScript validation</strong> is completely
                customizable, however, you will need to create it all yourself
                or use a JavaScript library.
            </li>
            <li>
                Built-in form validation is done by using validation attributes
                on the form elements. These attributes include:
                <br />
                <strong>required</strong> - This specifies whether a form field
                needs to be filled or not.
                <br />
                <strong>minlength</strong> and <strong>maxlength</strong> -
                These specify the minimum and maximum length of text that can be
                entered in. This is for the "string" data type.
                <br />
                <strong>min</strong> and <strong>max</strong> - These are used
                to specify the minimum and maximum values of the "number" data
                type.
                <br />
                <strong>type</strong> - This specifies whether the data needs to
                be a number, an email address, or other preset type.
                <br />
                <strong>pattern</strong> - This specifies a "regular expression"
                that defines a pattern which the entered data needs to follow.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can take advantage of CSS to style the form elements by
                using either <strong>:valid</strong> or
                <strong>:invalid</strong> pseudo-classes
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>textarea</strong> element does NOT support the
                "pattern" attribute.
            </li>
            <li>
                For a better user experience, if using the
                <strong>maxlength</strong> attribute, you should also provide
                the user with a character count so they know how many characters
                they have left before reaching the max length of characters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Automated error messages (the messages that are produced when
                using HTML built-in validation) have 2 drawbacks:
                <br />
                1. There is no standard way ot change the look and feel with
                CSS.
                <br />
                2. They depend on the browser locale. This means you could have
                a web-page written in english, but if you were on a laptop in
                France, your automated errors would be written out in French.
            </li>
            <li>
                When validating forms with JavaScript, a good API to use that is
                recognized by most browsers is the
                <strong>Constraint validation API</strong>. Details of the
                Constraint validation API can be found

                <strong><em>Using the Fetch API</em></strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                A basic fetch request is simple to set up, and looks something
                like this:
                <br />
                <code>
                    fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
                    <br />
                    .then((response) => response.json())
                    <br />
                    .then((data) => console.log(data));
                </code>
                <br />
                <br />
                To explain this code:
                <br />
                We are fetching a JSON file across the network and printing it
                to the console. The simplest use of fetch() takes one argument —
                the path to the resource you want to fetch — and does not
                directly return the JSON response body but instead returns a
                promise that resolves with a Response object. The Response
                object, in turn, does not directly contain the actual JSON
                response body but is instead a representation of the entire HTTP
                response. So, to extract the JSON body content from the Response
                object, we use the json() method, which returns a second promise
                that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text
                as JSON.
            </li>
            <li>
                When using the <code>fetch()</code> method, your first parameter
                is necessary. This first parameter is the URL you wish to fetch
                from.
                <br />
                The second parameter is optional. This is an
                <code>init</code> object that allows you to control a number of
                different settings, such as (to name a few):
                <br />
                method: "POST" //GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
                <br />
                mode: "cors" //no-cors, *cors, same-origin
                <br />
                headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
                //"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
            </li>
            <li>
                You can have browsers send their credentials along with their
                request by adding <code>credentials: "include"</code> to the
                <strong>init</strong> object that is passed as the second
                parameter in the <code>fetch()</code> method.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can check that a fetch was successful by first checking that
                the promise from the fetch resolved by using
                <strong>.then(response)</strong> followed by checking the
                <strong>response.ok</strong> property to see if it has a value
                of true. It would look something like this:
                <br />
                <code>
                    fetch("example.jpg")
                    <br />.then((response) => {
                    <br />
                    if (!response.ok) {
                    <br />
                    throw new Error("Network response was not OK");
                    <br />
                    }
                    <br />
                    return response.blob();
                    <br />
                    })
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>Headers</code> interface allows you to create your own
                headers object via the <code>headers()</code> constructor. A
                headers object is a simple multi-map of names to values.
            </li>
            <li>
                A good use case for headers is checking whether the content type
                is correct before you process it further. An example of this:
                <br />
                <code>
                    fetch(myRequest)
                    <br />
                    .then((response) => {
                    <br />
                    const contentType = response.headers.get('content-type');
                    <br />
                    if (!contentType ||
                    !contentType.includes('application/json')) {
                    <br />
                    throw new TypeError("Oops, we haven't got JSON!");
                    <br />
                    }
                    <br />
                    return response.json();
                    <br />
                    })
                    <br />
                    .then((data) => { /* process your data further */ })
                    <br />
                    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
                    <br />
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                The most common response properties that you will use include:
                <br />
                <code>Response.status</code> - An integer (default value is 200)
                containing the response status code.
                <br />
                <code>Response.statusText</code> - A string (default value ""),
                which corresponds to the HTTP status code message.
                <br />
                <code>Response.ok</code> - This is used for checking that the
                status code is in the range of 200-299 inclusive. This returns a
                boolean value.
            </li>
