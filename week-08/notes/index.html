                <strong><em>Transforms and Transitions</em></strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>Transform</strong> property allows us to manipulate
                the appearance of any element on the page. We can use:
                <br />
                - translate
                <br />
                - rotate
                <br />
                - scale
                <br />
                - skew
            </li>
            <li>
                Transforms do not work on inline elements. However you can make
                that work by adding <code>display: inline-block;</code> to the
                element.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Translate</strong> allows us to move elements up, down,
                left, or right, in the format - translate(x, y).
                <br />
                An example of translate looks like this:
                <br />
                <code>transform: translate(45px, -45px)</code>
                <br />
                This would move the element right and up by 45 pixels each.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scale</strong> allows us to grow and shrink an element,
                in the format - scale(x, y).
                <br />
                An example of scale looks like this:
                <br />
                <code>transform: scale(.5, 2);</code>
                <br />
                This would shrink the width of the element by half, and this
                would double the height of the element.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Rotation</strong> allows us to rotate an element by a
                specified angle, in the format - rotate(25deg);
                <br />
                An example of rotate looks like this:
                <br />
                <code>transform: rotate(25deg);</code>
                <br />
                This would rotate our element by 25 degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Skew</strong> allows us to skew an element along its x
                and y axis, in the format - skew(30deg, 90deg)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transition</strong> contains 4 properties, they are:
                <br />
                - transition-property
                <br />
                - transition-duration
                <br />
                - transition-timing-function
                <br />
                - transition-delay
            </li>
            <li>
                We can use shorthand declaration to target each of those
                properties in a single statement, like this:
                <br />
                <code>
                    div {
                    <br />
                    transition: transform 2s ease-out 50ms;
                    <br />
                    }
                </code>
                <br />
                Examples of those transitions can be found here:
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp"

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Animations</strong> will animate elements over time.
                They have much more functionality over typical
                <strong>transitions</strong> because unlike transitions only
                being able to define starting and ending states, animations
                allow you to control each step of an animation via
                <strong>keyframes</strong>.
                <br />
                To create an animation, you need to use the
                <code>@keyframes</code> rule. The beginning of creating an
                animation would look something like this:
                <br />
                <code>
                    @keyframes myAnimation {
                    <br />
                    /* put animation keyframes here */
                    <br />
                    }
                </code>
                <br />
                <br />
                There is a lot that goes along with animations. For examples of
                animations, they can be found here:
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp"

                It's important to note that just because you can make CSS do all
                types of fun and crazy animations, we need to hold ourselves
                back in the professional world. We should use transitions and
                animations where it makes sense, but to really restrain
                ourselves from going overboard and make our professional website
                look/feel tacky.

                <strong><em>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</em></strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                Canvas was first developed by Apple. It allows you to draw
                anything that you can imagine, all through JavaScript. Canvas
                allows you to draw shapes, lines, arcs, text, gradients,
                patterns. You can also manipulate pixels in images and video as
                well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Canvas uses the coordinate system, which works like this:
                <br />
                The top-left corner of the canvas has the coordinates (0, 0). If
                the canvas is 200px by 200px, then the bottom-right corner of
                the canvas would contain the coordinates (200, 200).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>SVG</strong> stands for Scalable Vector Graphic. It is a
                specific file format which will allow you to describe vector
                graphics using XML.
            </li>
            <li>
                An important feature of vector images is that they will preserve
                their quality even as you enlarge or shrink the image.
            </li>
            <li>
                A great open source tool that you can use to create SVG images
                is called Inkscape, and you can visit the site
                <a href="http://inkscape.org">HERE</a> to download the program
            </li>
            <li>
                What's the difference between using Canvas or SVG, since both of
                these technologies allow you to draw custom shapes, paths, and
                fonts?
                <br />
                <br />
                - Canvas allows for pixel manipulation, however, canvas operates
                in "immediate mode". This means that you are unable to simply
                add more to the canvas you're currently working on. Each time a
                shape is finished drawing, canvas no longer has access to that
                shape. It doesn't persist as an object that you can modify. So
                if you want to add to what you've already drawn on the canvas,
                you need to redraw the new shape from scratch.
                <br />
                <br />
                - Canvas is much faster than SVG, due to the fact that the DOM
                does not have access to what is drawn on the canvas. This would
                make canvas a better option if you want to design a game that
                requires a lot of animations.
                <br />
                <br />
                - SVG's mode is called "retained mode". This means that what you
                draw to SVG, it is accessible via the DOM. The structure of the
                image is preserved in the XML document.
                <br />
                <br />
                - Because SVG is a file format - instead of a set of methods
                which allow you to dynamically draw on a surface - you are
                unable to manipulate SVG images the way you can manipulate
                pixels on canvas. For example, it would be impossible to use SVG
                to convert a color video to black and white, which is possible
                with canvas.
                <br />
                <br />
                - A good rule of thumb: If you want to paint pixels to the
                screen, without needing to retrieve and modify your shapes, use
                Canvas. If you need to access and change specific aspects of
                your graphics, SVG will most likely be better.

                The <strong>Drag and Drop</strong> API allows us to specify
                which elements we want to make draggable, and also specify what
                should happen when these draggable elements are dragged and
                dropped over other elements on a page.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is important to note: This API is unsupported by Android and
                iOS.

                the Drag and Drop API:
