        Errors: Caused when something goes wrong in the program, they are
        usually caused by one of the following:
        <br />
        - System error - A problem with the system or external devices with
        which the program is interacting
        <br />
        - Programmer error - The program contains incorrect syntax or faulty
        logic; something like a typo
        <br />
        - User error - the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program
        is unable to handle
      </li>
      <li>
        Exceptions: An error that produces a return value that can then be used
        by the program to deal with the error.
        <br />
        - An example would be trying to call a method that does not exist. This
        will give you a reference error that raises an exception
      </li>
      <li>
        Warnings: Can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to
        cause the program to crash. This will allow the program to run after a
        warning occurs
        <br />
        - An example would be when assigning a value to a variable that hasn't
        been declared
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strict Mode</strong> will produce more exceptions and warnings,
        as well as prohibit the use of some deprecated features. Strict mode
        will consider poorly written code as actual errors. Strict mode is used
        to encourage better quality of JavaScript.
        <br />
        To enable strict mode, you simply add the line of code
        <code>"use strict";</code> to the first line of the JavaScript file
      </li>
      <li>
        To apply a JavaScript module to your HTML page, you would write this
        code into the header of your HTML page:
        <br />
        <code>>script type="module" src="main.js">>/script></code>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can create a module object, which can let you import all of a
        JavaScript module features from a specific module with the following
        code:
        <br />
        <code>import * as Module from "./modules/module.js";</code>
        <br />
        By using the "*", this will grab all of the exports available inside of
        the module.js file. This would allow you to then call any of the
        available functions, for example:
        <br />
        <code>Module.function1();</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        When using a try/catch block, you can also use a
        <strong>finally</strong> block. The <strong>finally</strong> block will
        always be executed after the try or catch block, regardless of whether
        an exception occurred or not. This is useful if you want to some code to
        run in either case (try or catch)
      </li>
      <li>
        Test-driven Development (TDD) - This is the process of writing tests
        before any actual code. First, you write tests that will fail (since
        there is no code to test at first), then you write some code that will
        allow the tests to pass, the lastly, the code is refactored to make it
        faster, more readable, and remove any repetition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jest</strong> is a TDD framework created by Facebook. It makes
        it easy to create and run tests.
        <br />
        You start by creating a js file that ends in test.js. For example:
        <code>mycode.test.js</code>
        <br />
        Next, you write a test() function inside the file, and pass the test
        function parameters depending on what code you want tested.
        <br />
        When you run <strong>jest</strong>, all files that end with "test.js"
        within the folder you are testing will be tested and provide you the
        results
      </li>
    </ul>
