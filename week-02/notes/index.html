    <h1>Week 02 Notes</h1>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Note: Much of the topics in this chapter were a review for me. But I
        wanted to take some notes of things that I find important to remember,
        even if I understand the concept.
      </li>
      <li>
        Template literals use back ticks (` `) and allow for interpolation of
        JavaScript code. The JavaScript expression is placed inside curly braces
        with a dollar sign in front of them - ${ }.
        <br />
        While I understand this concept. My goal of this note is to remind
        myself to take advantage of it more often, because I tend to use the
        concatenation method more often, which I can get a bit unruly when it
        gets large.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is important to remember when deleting items from an array, if using
        the <code>delete</code> operator, an index will still remain in the
        array. It will be given a value of <code>undefined</code>.
        <br />
        For example:
        <br />
        <code
          >delete movies[2];<br />["Jurassic Park", "Back To The Future",
          undefined]</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Destructuring as array is the concept of taking values out of an array
        and presenting them as individual values. We can assign multiple values
        at the same time.
        <br />
        For example:
        <br />
        <code>const [x,y] = [1,2];</code>
        <br />
        When we check the value of <code>x</code>, we get 1. And likewise,
        checking the value of <code>y</code>, we get 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        Something I often forget - using a switch/case statement. This is
        especially useful when needing multiple if and else statements. REMEMBER
        to use <code>break;</code> after each case statement you provide.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nested <code>for</code> loops have been tricky for me at times.
        <br />
        Remember, the <strong>inner</strong> loop will run ALL THE WAY THROUGH
        before the next step in the <strong>outer</strong> loop occurs.
      </li>
      <li>
        *Good to remember* - ALL functions return a value. if it is not
        explicitly stated, the function will return <code>undefined</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Using <strong>Function Expressions</strong> is a way of defining a
        function and assigning it to a variable. This differs from
        <strong>Function Declarations</strong> because you are not assigning the
        function to a variable
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Callbacks</strong> - these are functions that are passed as an
        argument to another function.
        <br />
        For example:
        <br />
        <code>
          function sing(song, callback) {
          <br />
          console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.`);
          <br />
          callback();
          <br />
          }
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrow functions are useful in a few ways from regular functions:
        <br />
        1. They are a new (as of ES6) shorthand notation to help shorten your
        code.
        <br />
        2. They can be used for writing anonymous functions. Anonymous functions
        are handy for times when the function will only be used once.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Function Declarations</strong> can be invoked BEFORE they are
        defined because they are "hoisted" to the top of the scope.
        <br />
        However, <strong>Function Expressions</strong> cannot be invoked until
        AFTER they are defined.
      </li>
    </ul>
